Aesprite is one of those things that everybody says is really good and that you should buy, but I never did for a long time. This is because I used an app called Blockbench. Traditionally, it is a low-poly 3D modelling app, but it has a new pixel art mode, so I tried it out.

It was actually okay! And, I made some pretty cool things. Until then, I had to create around 30 sprites for a game (Rainycards) - but, we all know that it never got released. It was so hard to do even basic stuff, so I stopped making pixel art.

Rainycards was cancelled, and I needed to make a new logo for Hollowcraft, the best kitpvp server(!!1!!!1!!)  So, I fired up Blockbench again. It went really well, and I made the logo that still stands to this day.

However, when I saved it, it didn't save the layers, it was just a basic, flat, PNG file. And, I didn't want the swords the swords on the logo anymore. So, I decided to research pixel art apps.

I've heard of Aseprite before and before, so it was my first idea when I needed a new one. And, my friend proplayer919 had it - it seemed like the greatest deal. I checked the price and it was 30 dollars. That was actually quite a bit of money for something that I can get for free.

But, alas, I bought Aseprite - and that's where I am today.
